The Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics is a simple, browser-based solution that allows users to receive detailed insights into how they spend their time online.  The extension is designed with simplicity and performance in mind, running seamlessly in the background and automatically logging the amount of time spent on each page visited during the day.  As users travel between tabs and websites, the extension records the time spent per domain and securely stores this information in Chrome's local storage.  This allows users to visualise and examine their digital behaviours without requiring any human input or configuration.  The basic feature is on catching tab activity events and computing durations in milliseconds, which are then consolidated under domain names such as "youtube.com" or "wikipedia.org".The plugin has a user-friendly popup interface that presents this data in a compact and visible way, with time in hours, minutes, and seconds for each domain.  A reset button allows users to delete the saved data and start over whenever they choose.

 This application is great for remote professionals, students, researchers, and anybody looking to reduce digital distractions and increase productivity.  Unlike typical time trackers that rely on manual check-ins or external timers, this Chrome Extension uses natural browser events and permissions to automate the entire process.  As a result, it offers real-time behavioural data with no friction and no privacy-invading procedures.  Because all data is saved locally, individuals have complete control over their information, making it a more privacy-friendly option to cloud-based monitoring solutions.Whether you want to know how much time you spend on social media, track your research efforts, or stay focused during work sessions, this extension provides a dependable and transparent solution.

 This addon can be enhanced in the future to incorporate features such as category classification (e.g., productive versus unproductive sites), CSV or JSON export for data analysis, graphic charts using libraries such as Chart.js, daily/weekly use summary, and even time restriction goal-setting.  For the time being, its basic approach assures that it is simple to install, straightforward to use, and resource-light, making it appropriate for all levels of Chrome users, from casual to professional.
